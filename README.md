##### An App for a Tap Room

## Description

A site that manages drinks for a tap room.  

In terms of setting up and conceptually structuring projects, I feel like Angular and REACT are very similar.  Being a framework, Angular has set locations for backend functionality whereas REACT does not.  I am unsure how backend functionality will work in REACT nor do I think it will be very similar to Angular.  I think the styling is a bit more cluttered in REACT since there is no separate css file.  The passing of data in Angular I found to be quite cumbersome and hope that it is easier in REACT.

## Setup

  * Git clone the file  
  * Run npm install  
  * npm start

## Technologies Used

  **ReactJS**

## Notes
  During the rebuild process I noticed a few things that could be a problem once I add functionality.  I'm not sure my current routing is ideal for editing elements or for dynamically changing the colors/styling.  I'm also unsure how I will be able to add functions such as subtracting pints that were bought.

## Spec

* Display list of kegs.
* Recreate styling of Tap Room
* Add functionality to create kegs and see details
* Create ability to sell pints
